When my kids were younger, they would complain to me, "Dad,I'm so bored, there's nothing to do." And there are two things  going on there in that comment. The first is a lack of imagination. "I'm so bored, I can't see anything worthwhile todo." That's resignation. And then there's also a loss of agency."Im so bored, there's nothing I can do to get out of this."
我的孩子更小时会对我抱怨：「爸，我好无聊，没事可以做。」这句话里，有两个状况。第一个是缺乏想像力。「我好无聊，我找不到任何值得做的事。」那就是屈从。第二个是自主权的丧失：「我好无聊，我无法做什么来脱离这个情境。」
